        "\n",
        "For online retailers like Amazon, having access to a vast inventory network across multiple locations is crucial for efficient and timely delivery of products to customers. The significance of selecting the right warehouse location or partnering with local warehouses has grown substantially with the recent expansion of services such as Amazon Prime and the introduction of new services like Amazon Prime Now.\n",
        "\n",
        "To meet the rising demand, Amazon has decided to establish new warehouses in the Gulf Coast region. After conducting thorough research, four potential warehouse locations have been identified, each with a specific capacity and average cost-per-unit for shipping to any of the five Gulf Coast states. The table below presents the capacity and operating cost of each warehouse, along with the average cost-per-unit for shipping products to any state.\n",
